Documenting USDA endpoints. Some quite nuanced data is available. Intention is to break down API's by USDA service / agency facet (ERS, NASS, FAS, etc). The USDA collects a lot of statistics, some of which trickle on to the BEA and thus FRED, but some of it seems better accessed directly from the USDA.  

Current notebooks:
- ers-api.ipynb (incomplete) : Methods for grabbing and plotting data served by the ERS's API's. So far, have documented API's for grabbing farm economic data, TODO geospatial (mapping) API's

Next:
- Notebooks for NASS and FAS API's, these wings of the USDA publish other interesting data
